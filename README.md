# VisualMathProjects

A unified, code-only collection of visual math experiments.

## Projects
- `FFT2D`: 2D Fourier image reconstruction notebook.
- `FFT1D`: 1D Fourier audio reconstruction notebook.
- `NumberVisualizer`: canvas-based number factorization visualizer.
- `STFTChordDetector`: notebook + live app for chord detection from FFT/STFT.
- `DCT2D`: 2D DCT basis and stripwise reconstruction notebook.

Each folder contains its own concise `README.md` with run instructions.
